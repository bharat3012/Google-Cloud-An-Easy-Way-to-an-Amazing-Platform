So you finally decided to get into the Deep Learning game only to realize that training your Deep Learning models on your laptop takes a zillion years because either you don’t have a GPU and so you have to train your models on a CPU or you are even more unlucky and are stuck with AMD. Either way, I know how it feels and it truly sucks :(
      ## Get your game on already, AMD!

In cloud computing, the capital investment in building and maintaining data centers is replaced by consuming IT resources as an elastic, utility-like service from a cloud “provider” (including storage, computing, networking, data processing and analytics, application development, machine learning, and even fully managed services).

 **Important Note

Some users, who have signed up for GCP recently, can see this error on starting their projects

                         “Quota ‘GPUS_ALL_REGIONS’ exceeded. Limit: 0.0 globally.”

Please go to Dashboard-> IAM & admin -> Quotas -> I and search for the following quota 'GPUs (all region)' .

In case limit for this is 0, you need to request Google to increase this to 1 or whatever value you need.
